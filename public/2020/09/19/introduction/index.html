<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p>Nowadays most people care about the overall quality of a building and especially the security condition when looking for rental apartments. In this paper we explore the Apartment Building Evaluation dataset, which is from the Toronto Open Data Portal. We find that majority of the buildings are evaluated from various aspects and the security conditions are mostly good. Our findings have important implications for improving apartment environment and making choices when looking for rental buildings.</p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>More and more people rent apartments these days for study, work, or other purposes, and the quality of the buildings has strong influence on the quality of their life. Thus we will study the Apartment Building Evaluation dataset, in order to get more information about the living environment of rental apartments, e.g.Â from the aspect of security, which is super important for tenants. And the study will also give some advice for people who are looking for rental apartments, and can help with enforcing standards and improving the living environment for Toronto residents.</p>
<p>In this paper, we mainly focus on two interested variables: SECURITY, which represents the score of security condition of evaluated buildings; and NO_OF_AREAS_EVALUATED, which reflects how thorough and complete the evaluation is. We find that most of the evaluated buildings have a pretty good security condition, and majority of them are evaluated thoroughly from lots of different areas.</p>
<p>In this paper, firstly we have a Data section which includes a description and preview of the dataset, a description and summary statistic of the interested variables, and their graphs with some explanation. Then we have a Discussion section regarding to the main findings of the graphs, features of the interested variables and dataset, and the implications in the context of study. Moreover, there is a section of Weaknesses and Next Steps. And finally there are the References of the dataset and all R packages used in this paper.</p>
