      <description>Abstract Nowadays most people care about the overall quality of a building and especially the security condition when looking for rental apartments. In this paper we explore the Apartment Building Evaluation dataset, which is from the Toronto Open Data Portal. We find that majority of the buildings are evaluated from various aspects and the security conditions are mostly good. Our findings have important implications for improving apartment environment and making choices when looking for rental buildings.</description>
